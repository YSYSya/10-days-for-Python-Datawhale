    "## a） Variables and Datatypes\n",
    "### Python Variables, Constants and Literals\n",
    "Python is completely object oriented, and not  \"statically typed\". You do not need to declare variables before using  them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.\n",
    "**In Python we don't assign values to the variables, whereas Python gives the reference of the object (value) to the variable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of the programming languages a variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. Each variable must have a unique name called identifier. It is helpful to think of variables as container that hold data which can be changed later throughout programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned on a module. Here, the module means a new file containing variables, functions etc which is imported to main file. Inside the module, constants are written in all **capital letters and underscores** separating the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.Rules and Naming convention for variables and constants\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a name that makes sense. Suppose, vowel makes more sense than v.\n",
    "2. Use camelCase notation to declare a variable. It starts with lowercase letter. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "myName\n",
    "myAge\n",
    "myAddress\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Use capital letters where possible to declare a constant. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "PI\n",
    "G\n",
    "MASS\n",
    "TEMP\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Never use special symbols like !, @, #, %, etc.\n",
    "5. Don't start name with a digit.\n",
    "6. Constants are put into Python modules and meant not be changed.\n",
    "7. Constant and variable names should have combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "snake_case\n",
    "MACRO_CASE\n",
    "camelCase\n",
    "CapWords\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### 4.Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "Literal is a raw data given in a variable or constant. In Python, there are various types of literals they are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numeric Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). Numeric literals can belong to 3 different numerical types Integer, Float and Complex.\n",
