    "# Introduction to OOPs in Python\n",

    "An object has two characteristics:\n",

    "    behavior\n",
    "The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).Object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. And, class is a blueprint for the object.An object is also called an instance of a class and the process of creating this object is called instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles:\n",

    "\n",
    "Class functions that begins with double underscore (__) are called special functions as they have special meaning.\n",

    "Of one particular interest is the __init__() function. This special function gets called whenever a new object of that class is instantiated.\n",
